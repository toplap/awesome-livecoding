## Tips and content formatting

* Make sure your suggestion isn't already there
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Check your spelling and grammar (nobody is perfect anyway)
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
* The pull request and commit should be clear of what has been updated
